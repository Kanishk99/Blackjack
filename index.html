            <h2>THE BASIC RULES WHEN PLAYING BLACKJACK:</h2>
            <p> </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Blackjack starts with players making bets.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as
                        10 and the ace<br> can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The
                        total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Players must decide whether to stand, hit, surrender, double down, or split.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Players win when their hand totals higher than dealer's hand, or they have 21 or less when
                        the dealer busts<br> (i.e., exceeds 21)</p>

            <h1>Card Rules</h1>


            <p class=>All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10
                and the ace can count as either 1 or 11.<br> Card suits have no meaning in blackjack.
                The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand. A hand<br> containing a 4-5-8
                totals 17.
                Another containing a queen-5 totals 15. It is always assumed that the ace counts as<br> 11 unless so
                doing
                would make your hand total exceed 21, in which case the ace reverts to a value of 1.</p>

        </span>

        <span class="rules">
            <h1>Hitting Rules</h1>

            <p>This means you want the dealer to give another card to your hand. In shoe games,
                indicate to the dealer that you<br> want a hit by making a beckoning motion with your finger
                or tapping the table behind your cards with your finger.<br> In hand-held games, scratch the
                edges of the cards in your hand lightly on the felt </p>
        </span>

        <span class="rules">
            <h1>Standing Rules</h1>

            <p>This means you are satisfied with the total of the hand and want to stand with the
                cards you have. In shoe games,<br> indicate that you want to stand by waving your hand
                over the cards, palm down. In hand-held games, tuck your<br> cards under the chips that
                you have in the betting box.</p>
        </span>

        <span class="rules">
            <h1>Surrender</h1>

            <p>This playing option is sometimes permitted. It allows a player to forfeit the hand
                immediately with an automatic<br> loss of half the original bet. In most venues, players
                can surrender their initial two-card hand only after the dealer has<br> checked his cards and
                ascertained that he doesn't have a blackjack (known as late surrender). Once a
                player draws a card,<br> the surrender option is no longer available. If the dealer has
                a blackjack hand, then surrender is not available.</p>
