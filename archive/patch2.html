			<h2>THE BASIC RULES WHEN PLAYING BLACKJACK:</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Blackjack starts with players making bets.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10 and the ace<br> can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Players must decide whether to stand, hit, surrender, double down, or split.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Players win when their hand totals higher than dealer's hand, or they have 21 or less when the dealer busts<br> (i.e., exceeds 21)</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
	  <h1>Card Rules</h1>
    
      
      <p class=>All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10
		  and the ace can count as either 1 or 11.<br> Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. 
		  The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand. A hand<br> containing a 4-5-8 totals 17. 
		  Another containing a queen-5 totals 15. It is always assumed that the ace counts as<br> 11 unless so doing 
		  would make your hand total exceed 21, in which case the ace reverts to a value of 1.</p>


		  <h1>Hitting Rules</h1>
		  
		  <p>This means you want the dealer to give another card to your hand. In shoe games,
		   indicate to the dealer that you<br> want a hit by making a beckoning motion with your finger
			or tapping the table behind your cards with your finger.<br> In hand-held games, scratch the
			 edges of the cards in your hand lightly on the felt    </p>

			 <h1>Standing Rules</h1>
      
      <p>This means you are satisfied with the total of the hand and want to stand with the 
		  cards you have. In shoe games,<br> indicate that you want to stand by waving your hand
		   over the cards, palm down. In hand-held games, tuck your<br> cards under the chips that
		    you have in the betting box.</p>
	 
	  <h1>Surrender</h1>
      
      <p>This playing option is sometimes permitted. It allows a player to forfeit the hand
		   immediately with an automatic<br> loss of half the original bet. In most venues, players
			can surrender their initial two-card hand only after the dealer has<br> checked his cards and
			 ascertained that he doesn't have a blackjack (known as late surrender). Once a
			  player draws a card,<br> the surrender option is no longer available. If the dealer has 
			  a blackjack hand, then surrender is not available.</p>
